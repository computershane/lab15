# Task 2  Overt, Covert, and Surreptitious Entry

Learn the different methods of entry

Overt entry is when the method of entry causes damage or destruction. 
This could be damage or destruction to locks, doors, windows, walls or other objects.

Covert entry is usually undetectable to un-trained people. However, during
a forensic investigation by trained professionals, the method of entry would be discovered.

Surreptitious entry is when the method of entry is undetectable to both
un-trained and trained people. This method would most likely go unnoticed even during a forensic investigation.
